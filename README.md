> Small state manager written in Typescript

### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/Tsukugi/Taihou#readme)

## Install

```sh
npm i @atsu/taihou
```

## Usage 

First of all, there is two concepts to know:
1. Sections: A section is the core of the Store, it has three properties `state`, `actions` and `processes`. 

   After you define the state, you can define all possible actions that will commit your new state to the section on `actions`. 
   And if you have an async operation, you could define it in `processes`.
   
2. Immutability: A user would never have to modify the state directly but instead provide your new state to the store to handle it, so a created section will expose `commit` and `process`. These will call the specified `action` or `process` function and update the state accordingly.

   A thing to note here is that we want to provide the new state to the section, so please return a new object with the new state.
   
```ts
import { createSection } from "@atsu/taihou";

const taihou = createSection({
    state: {
      list: [ 0 ],   // Default value
    },
    actions: {
      set: (payload, state) => ({ list: [...state.list, ...payload] }),
    },
    processes: {
      setAsync: async (payload, { state, commit, process }) => {
          const newList = await doSomethingAsyncWithPromises(payload) 
          
          return { list: [...state.list, ...newList] },
      }
    }
  });
```

After creation you can use the section with:
   
```ts
taihou.state.list // value: [ 0 ]

// Update the taihou section synchronously. 
// Also TS should infer your defined function names so no mistakes for the name
taihou.actions.commit("set", [ 1, 2 ])   

taihou.state.list // value [ 0, 1, 2 ] 

// Update the taihou section asynchronously. 
const setAsync: Promise<number[]> = taihou.actions.process("setAsync", [ 3, 4 ])

taihou.state.list // value [ 0, 1, 2 ] - Value is not updated immediately

setAsync.then(newState=> {
  console.log(newState);  // value [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ] 
});

```

Store: A store by `createStore` is nothing else than a wrapper for your `sections`, it provides a single `store` object that would be your State manager and also `useStore` that is a wrapper function to use on components (e.g. Vue3's DefineComponent), it is intended to have more features for it in the future.

```js

const {store, useStore} = createStore({
 taihou: createSection({ /* section definition */}),
 azuma: createSection({ /* section definition */}),
 atago: createSection({ /* section definition */}),
});

useStore(store => {
  // here the store reference is available 
})

// In Vue 3
useStore(store => defineComponent({
  mounted(){
    console.log(store.taihou);   // here the store reference is available 
  }
}))

```

npm run test
```
